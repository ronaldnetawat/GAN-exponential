# Training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate data points

- Creating training data conforming to the exponential equation $y = 1.08^x$
- Building a generator and discriminator network.
- Compiling both the networks with their respective losses, optimizers, etc.
- Training both the networks with the use of several training functions. 
- Testing the generator by forming fake data and training it to generate new data.
